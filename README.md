### Project Description
The Angry Calculator is a web-based application built using Python and Flask that performs basic arithmetic operations while responding with humorous or sarcastic messages. It combines simple calculation logic with creative user interaction to make an otherwise ordinary tool entertaining and engaging.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
This project humorously addresses the lack of personality and engagement in traditional calculator applications. By introducing sarcastic and playful responses, it transforms a routine utility into an interactive experience. While not solving a conventional problem, the Angry Calculator explores how emotional and entertaining feedback can enhance user interaction in even the most basic digital tools.
### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
I solved the serious issue of calculators being way too polite. The Angry Calculator skips the math and goes straight for your ego ‚Äî because nothing motivates learning like a digital insult.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- python

This image shows the output screen of the Angry Calculator after performing a basic addition operation. The user entered:
First Number: 2
Operation: Addition (+)
Second Number: 1
After clicking the ‚ÄúCALCULATE‚Äù button, instead of displaying the numerical result, the app humorously responds with the sarcastic message:

This image displays the "Angry Calculator" in action during a multiplication task. The user input is:
First Number: 57
Operation: Multiplication (√ó)
Second Number: 55
Upon clicking the ‚ÄúCALCULATE‚Äù button, instead of showing the result, the calculator delivers a snarky response:
"Go get a pen and paper, find it yourself ...."
